**BRIEF**

Overall objective with this project is the following:

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The requirements of the project are as follows:

1.  A Trello board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion
    on user stories, use cases and tasks needed to complete the project.
    It could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced
    creating your project.
    
2.  A relational database used to store data persistently for the
    project, this database needs to have at least 2 tables in it, to
    demonstrate your understanding, you are also required to model a
    relationship.
    
3.  Clear Documentation from a design phase describing the architecture
    you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

4.  A functional CRUD application created in Python, following best
    practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
    your Kanban Board.

5.  Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, as
    well as automated tests for validation of the application. You must
    provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent
    reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.
    
6.  A functioning front-end website and integrated API's, using Flask.
    
7.  Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the
    Feature-Branch model which will subsequently be built through a CI
    server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
    
**MY APPROACH**

Music Database with Playlist Feature

My goal is to create an app that can be used like a basic spotify/ipod. It will contain songs that can be used to create playlists.

Users can add songs to a database, delete songs, view all songs in the database and update details of a songs.
Users can also add songs from the database to a particular playlist of their choice.
Users can also view all songs assigned to any playlist and filter songs by which playlist they're assigned to.
Users can create multiple playlists.

Requires two db to start
